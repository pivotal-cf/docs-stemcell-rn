This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to this stemcell, monitor your <%= vars.platform_name %> VM's current CPU and memory usage and scale those components if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, VMware recommends scaling that VM.
For more information about the performance impact of Meltdown-related stemcell patches on <%= vars.platform_name %> components and guidance on scaling, see [Performance Impact of Cloud Foundry Apps and Services Because of Spectre and Meltdown](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=297681) in the Knowledge Base.

For more information about monitoring and scaling <%= vars.platform_name %>, see [Monitoring <%= vars.platform_name %> VMs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/monitoring-index.html),
[Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/monitoring-key-cap-scaling.html),
and [Scaling <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Service/6.0/tas-for-vms/scaling-ert-components.html). Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors.
VMware recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
