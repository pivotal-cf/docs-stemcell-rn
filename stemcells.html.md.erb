### 3541.12

<span class='pivnet'>Available in Pivotal Network</span>

- Periodic Ubuntu and CentOS stemcell bump (March 12, 2018)

### 3541.8

<span class='pivnet'>Available in Pivotal Network</span>

**Release Date**: March 08, 2018

- Bump bosh-agent to 2.67.1
  - Agent will now respect previously set permissions and owner on sys/run, sys/log and data job directories
  - This should fix stemcell compatibility with Diego/Garden if Agent restarts
    - If you were using 3541.x stemcell for any of your deployments, it's recommended to update your deployments to this version before updating Director since that would cause Agent restart


### 3541.5

**Release Date**: February 22, 2018

- Bump Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for USN-3582-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

### 3541.4

**Release Date**: February 14, 2018

- Rolled back custom umask configuration as we found out it was different in some cases (depends on how processes were started)
  - Hardening of /var/vcap/jobs/* is still applied by the agent

### 3541.2

**Release Date**: February 08, 2018

- [breaking] Set default umask to 077 and further harden several /var/vcap/* directories
  - Note that you may have to change your release to adapt to this change
- [breaking] Renamed /var/vcap/bosh/bin/ntpdate to /var/vcap/bosh/bin/sync-time
- [breaking] Stop forwarding SSH events to bosh-agent
  - Agent no longer receives and forwards such events to HM. This should remove a lot of noisy generated by releases that expect a lot of SSH sessions (eg Gitlab). This information will continue to be available in logs forwarded to remote destinations (and locally /var/log/auth.log).
- Fixes `env.bosh.swap_size: 0` to work on more clouds (including GCP)

Misc

- Order stemcell tarballs so that upload-stemcell command can execute faster
- Generate `packages.txt` within stemcell tarball that includes list of installed packages (previously known under different name)

#### <a id='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 Addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
For more information about Meltdown, see the [Meltdown and Spectre Attacks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/meltdown-spectre-attacks/) blog post.

This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to this stemcell, monitor your PCF VM's current CPU and memory usage and scale those components if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, Pivotal recommends scaling that VM.
For more information about the performance impact of Meltdown-related stemcell patches on PCF components and guidance on scaling, see this [KB article](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Performance-Impact-of-Cloud-Foundry-Apps-and-Services-Because-of-Spectre-and-Meltdown).
</br>

For more information about monitoring and scaling PCF, see the [Monitoring PCF VMs from Ops Manager](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/customizing/monitoring.html),
[Key Capacity Scaling Indicators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/monitoring/key-cap-scaling.html),
and [Scaling PAS](../opsguide/scaling-ert-components.html) topics. Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors.
Pivotal recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.

### 40

**Release Date**: May 22, 2018

- First release of Ubuntu Xenial stemcells
- Notable differences from Ubuntu Trusty
  - Includes systemd instead of upstart
  - Includes 4.15 Linux Kernel instead of 4.4
  - Uses chronyd to sync time (runs as a daemon) instead of ntpdate
  - Does not include NFS utils by default

**Warning**: Do not _downgrade_ instances from Ubuntu Xenial to Ubuntu Trusty stemcells as it may corrupt persistent disk content since Trusty stemcells may decide to use sfdisk partitioner instead of parted partitioner selected by Xenial stemcells.
