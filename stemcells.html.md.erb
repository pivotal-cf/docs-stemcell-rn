#### <a id="3541-8"></a> 3541.8

**Release Date**: March 08, 2018

- Bump bosh-agent to 2.67.1
  - Agent will now respect previously set permissions and owner on sys/run, sys/log and data job directories
  - This should fix stemcell compatibility with Diego/Garden if Agent restarts
    - If you were using 3541.x stemcell for any of your deployments, it's recommended to update your deployments to this version before updating Director since that would cause Agent restart


#### <a id="3541-5"></a> 3541.5

- Bump Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for USN-3582-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

#### <a id="3541-4"></a> 3541.4

**Release Date**: February 15, 2018

- Rolled back custom umask configuration as we found out it was different in some cases (depends on how processes were started)
  - Hardening of /var/vcap/jobs/* is still applied by the agent

#### <a id="3541-2"></a> 3541.2

**Release Date**: February 09, 2018

- [breaking] Set default umask to 077 and further harden several /var/vcap/* directories
  - Note that you may have to change your release to adapt to this change
- [breaking] Renamed /var/vcap/bosh/bin/ntpdate to /var/vcap/bosh/bin/sync-time
- [breaking] Stop forwarding SSH events to bosh-agent
  - Agent no longer receives and forwards such events to HM. This should remove a lot of noisy generated by releases that expect a lot of SSH sessions (eg Gitlab). This information will continue to be available in logs forwarded to remote destinations (and locally /var/log/auth.log).
- Fixes `env.bosh.swap_size: 0` to work on more clouds (including GCP)

Misc

- Order stemcell tarballs so that upload-stemcell command can execute faster
- Generate `packages.txt` within stemcell tarball that includes list of installed packages (previously known under different name)

#### <a id='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 Addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
For more information about Meltdown, see [Meltdown and Spectre Attacks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/meltdown-spectre-attacks/) on the Cloud Foundry blog.
[USN-3522-2](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/usn-3522-2/) addresses the critical vulnerability in Ubuntu associated with Meltdown.

This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to this stemcell, monitor your <%= vars.platform_name %> VM's current CPU and memory usage and scale those components if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, VMware recommends scaling that VM.
For more information about the performance impact of Meltdown-related stemcell patches on <%= vars.platform_name %> components and guidance on scaling, see [Performance Impact of Cloud Foundry Apps and Services Because of Spectre and Meltdown](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Performance-Impact-of-Cloud-Foundry-Apps-and-Services-Because-of-Spectre-and-Meltdown) in the Knowledge Base.

For more information about monitoring and scaling <%= vars.platform_name %>, see [Monitoring <%= vars.platform_name %> VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/monitoring.html),

and [Scaling <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/application-service/operating/scaling-ert-components.html). Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors.
VMware recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
