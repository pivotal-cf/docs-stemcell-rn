**Description**:<br>
  Ziming Zhang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware Virtual GPU did not<br>
properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a NULL pointer<br>
dereference. A local attacker could possibly trigger this vulnerability to<br>
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-38096)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux<br>
kernel contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free<br>
vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or<br>
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6270)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless driver did not<br>
properly validate certain data structures, leading to a NULL pointer<br>
dereference. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of<br>
service. (CVE-2023-7042)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the HugeTLB file system component of the Linux<br>
Kernel contained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability. A privileged<br>
attacker could possibly use this to to cause a denial of service.<br>
(CVE-2024-0841)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the Intel Data Streaming and Intel Analytics<br>
Accelerator drivers in the Linux kernel allowed direct access to the<br>
devices for unprivileged users and virtual machines. A local attacker could<br>
use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-21823)<br>
<br>
Yuxuan Hu discovered that the Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol driver in the Linux<br>
Kernel contained a race condition, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.<br>

**Title**: USN-6898-3: Linux kernel kernel vulnerabilities<br>
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6898-3<br>
**Priorities**: medium,low,high<br>
**Description**:<br>
  Ziming Zhang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware Virtual GPU did not<br>
properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a NULL pointer<br>
dereference. A local attacker could possibly trigger this vulnerability to<br>
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-38096)<br>
<br>
Gui-Dong Han discovered that the software RAID driver in the Linux kernel<br>
contained a race condition, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability. A<br>
privileged attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service<br>
(system crash). (CVE-2024-23307)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Bluetooth subsystem<br>
in the Linux kernel when modifying certain settings values through debugfs.<br>
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.<br>
(CVE-2024-24857, CVE-2024-24858, CVE-2024-24859)<br>
<br>
Bai Jiaju discovered that the Xceive XC4000 silicon tuner device driver in<br>
the Linux kernel contained a race condition, leading to an integer overflow<br>
vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of<br>
service (system crash). (CVE-2024-24861)<br>
<br>
Chenyuan Yang discovered that the Unsorted Block Images (UBI) flash device<br>
volume management subsystem did not properly validate logical eraseblock<br>
sizes in certain situations. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a<br>
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-25739)<br>
<br>
Several security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.<br>
An attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.<br>

**Title**: USN-6913-1: phpCAS vulnerability<br>
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6913-1<br>
**Priorities**: medium<br>
**Description**:<br>
  Filip Hejsek discovered that phpCAS was using HTTP headers to determine<br>
the service URL used to validate tickets. A remote attacker could<br>
possibly use this issue to gain access to a victim's account on a<br>
vulnerable CASified service.<br>
<br>
This security update introduces an incompatible API change. After applying<br>
this update, third party applications need to be modified to pass in an<br>
additional service base URL argument when constructing the client class.<br>
<br>
For more information please refer to the section<br>
"Upgrading 1.5.0 -> 1.6.0" of the phpCAS upgrading document:<br>

(CVE-2024-0841)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the Open vSwitch implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
could overflow its stack during recursive action operations under certain<br>
conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service<br>
(system crash). (CVE-2024-1151)<br>
<br>
Gui-Dong Han discovered that the software RAID driver in the Linux kernel<br>
contained a race condition, leading to an integer overflow vulnerability. A<br>

**Title**: USN-6766-3: Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities<br>
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6766-3<br>
**Priorities**: medium,high,low,negligible<br>
**Description**:<br>
  It was discovered that the Open vSwitch implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
could overflow its stack during recursive action operations under certain<br>
conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service<br>
(system crash). (CVE-2024-1151)<br>
<br>
Sander Wiebing, Alvise de Faveri Tron, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida<br>
discovered that the Linux kernel mitigations for the initial Branch History<br>
Injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-0001) were insufficient for Intel<br>
processors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive<br>
information. (CVE-2024-2201)<br>
<br>
Chenyuan Yang discovered that the RDS Protocol implementation in the Linux<br>
kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use<br>
this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-23849)<br>
<br>
Several security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.<br>
An attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.<br>

**Title**: USN-6766-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities<br>
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6766-1<br>
**Priorities**: medium,high,low,negligible<br>
**Description**:<br>
  It was discovered that the Open vSwitch implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
could overflow its stack during recursive action operations under certain<br>
conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service<br>
(system crash). (CVE-2024-1151)<br>
<br>
Sander Wiebing, Alvise de Faveri Tron, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida<br>
discovered that the Linux kernel mitigations for the initial Branch History<br>
Injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-0001) were insufficient for Intel<br>
processors. A local attacker could potentially use this to expose sensitive<br>
information. (CVE-2024-2201)<br>
<br>
Chenyuan Yang discovered that the RDS Protocol implementation in the Linux<br>
kernel contained an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker could use<br>
this to possibly cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-23849)<br>
<br>
Several security issues were discovered in the Linux kernel.<br>
An attacker could possibly use these to compromise the system.<br>

verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints,<br>
which could lead to excessive resource consumption. If a user or automated<br>
system were tricked into processing a specially crafted X.509 certificate<br>
chain that includes policy constraints, a remote attacker could possibly<br>
use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-0464)<br>
<br>
David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL was not properly handling invalid<br>
certificate policies in leaf certificates, which would result in certain<br>
policy checks being skipped for the certificate. If a user or automated<br>
system were tricked into processing a specially crafted certificate, a<br>
remote attacker could possibly use this issue to assert invalid<br>
certificate policies and circumvent policy checking. (CVE-2023-0465)<br>
<br>
David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly documented the<br>
functionalities of function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy, stating that<br>
it would implicitly enable certificate policy checks when doing<br>
certificate verifications, contrary to its implementation. This could<br>
cause users and applications to not perform certificate policy checks<br>
even when expected to do so. (CVE-2023-0466)<br>

Oleksenko discovered that some AMD processors could leak stale data from<br>
division operations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly<br>
use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20588)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when<br>
performing operations with kernel objects, leading to an out-of-bounds<br>
write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system<br>
crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45863)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the<br>
Linux kernel did not properly validate the server frame size in certain<br>
situation, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker<br>
could use this to construct a malicious CIFS image that, when operated on,<br>
could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive<br>
information. (CVE-2023-6606)<br>
<br>
Budimir Markovic, Lucas De Marchi, and Pengfei Xu discovered that the perf<br>
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate all event sizes<br>
when attaching new events, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.<br>
A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)<br>
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6931)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A<br>
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)<br>
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6932)<br>

service (system crash). (CVE-2023-3772)<br>
<br>
Kyle Zeng discovered that the networking stack implementation in the Linux<br>
kernel did not properly validate skb object size in certain conditions. An<br>
attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or<br>
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42752)<br>
<br>
Kyle Zeng discovered that the netfiler subsystem in the Linux kernel did<br>
not properly calculate array offsets, leading to a out-of-bounds write<br>
vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service<br>
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-42753)<br>
<br>
Kyle Zeng discovered that the IPv4 Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP)<br>
classifier implementation in the Linux kernel contained an out-of-bounds<br>
read vulnerability. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of<br>
service (system crash). Please note that kernel packet classifier support<br>
for RSVP has been removed to resolve this vulnerability. (CVE-2023-42755)<br>
<br>
Bing-Jhong Billy Jheng discovered that the Unix domain socket<br>
implementation in the Linux kernel contained a race condition in certain<br>
situations, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker<br>
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly<br>
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-4622)<br>
<br>
Budimir Markovic discovered that the qdisc implementation in the Linux<br>
kernel did not properly validate inner classes, leading to a use-after-free<br>
vulnerability. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service<br>

#### Fixes<br>
* There is an existing kernel bug in Xenial that can prevent the Precision Hardware Clock used in Azure stemcells from correctly tracking the time. To work around this problem we've changed the Azure stemcells to once again use the NTP servers in the config provided by BOSH. If your Azure network does not allow output NTP traffic to your configured NTP servers you may need to update your firewall rules to allow this traffic now.<br>

**Release Date**: December 17, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* `/var/opt` is now mounted to the ephemeral disk rather than the root disk. This is not a recommended storage point for bosh workloads, but some agents deployed on stemcells write their logs to this folder and that could cause the root disk to fill up.<br>
<br>
#### Fixes <br>
* This release reverts the NATS firewall enhancement added in 621.183. Changes associated with this feature caused VMs to report a networking failed state and prevented monit firewall rules from being applied. The NATS firewall enhancement will be reintroduced in a future release. <br>

#### <a id="621-183"></a> 621.183

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: December 06, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict access to the NATS message bus except by the bosh agent. This provides an additional layer of security so even if an attacker is able to gain access to the NATS credentials, they would be unable to use those from a workload on a Bosh deployed VM. If you are attempting to debug NATS connectivity problems by directly connecting to the Bosh NATS server, you will need additional access; instructions can be [found here](https://bosh.io/docs/tips/#unreachable-agent).<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
Errors are present in the networking service post-start scripts for all BOSH-managed VMs which:<br>
* Causes networking service to report a failed state<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the monit service<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the NATS service<br>

#### <a id="621-151"></a> 621.151

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: September 14, 2021

#### Fixes<br>
* Updates the `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit` wrapper script to refer to `monit-actual` by absolute path, rather than relative path. This allows folks who reset or clear the `PATH` environment variable to actually be able to use the `monit` CLI. Prior to this fix, folks who cleared their `PATH` environment variable would see an error like: `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit: line 9: exec: monit-actual: not found`.<br>
* Fixes the "incorrect used memory reporting" issue introduced in stemcell version `621.141`. The Bosh Agent will now report the correct amount of memory used by all processes in the VM that it manages, rather than just the processes in its cgroup.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* We've seen failures with this version of the stemcell in vSphere when attempting to attach a persistent disk to a running VM. We are currently planning to address this issue with an update to the vSphere CPI. It should be fixed in vSphere CPI release >= v69. We have pulled the vSphere version of this stemcell for now.<br>
<br>
**Note**: This issue is fixed in stemcell version 621.154<br>

#### <a id="621-141"></a> 621.141

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: August 30, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict Monit API access to the Monit CLI and BOSH Agent. To see how to grant your program access to the Monit API, examine the new `monit` wrapper script, found at `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit`.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* The memory used by the VM that a Bosh Agent manages is incorrectly reported. The Agent will report very significantly smaller amounts of memory used by the VM than are actually used. This means that the "memory used" information in the output of `bosh vms --vitals` and related commands is incorrect. For now, avoid using this stemcell version, if you rely on the VM memory usage information reported by the Bosh Agent, Director, or the `bosh` CLI.<br>
**NOTE**: This issue has been resolved in Stemcell version 621.151.<br>

**Title**: USN-4336-2: GNU binutils vulnerabilities<br>
**URL**: https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-4336-2<br>
**Priorities**: low,medium<br>
**Description**:<br>
  USN-4336-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. This update provides<br>
the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.<br>
<br>
Original advisory details:<br>
<br>
 It was discovered that GNU binutils contained a large number of security<br>
 issues. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a<br>
 specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could cause GNU binutils to<br>
 crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary<br>
 code.<br>

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: March 05, 2021

#### Fixes Issues:<br>
<br>
GCP rsyslog behavior is fixed - cf ssh and rsyslog should be working as expected<br>
<br>
#### Important Notice:<br>
<br>
As of this release, on all IAASs, rsyslog will not start until `/var/log` is mounted. When used with a Bosh Agent, `/var/log` will automatically be mounted, and no further action is required.<br>
<br>
If you use this stemcell without a Bosh Agent and do not mount `/var/log`, then you need to do one of these two actions:<br>
<br>
* Remove the `ExecStartPre=` line from `/etc/systemd/system/rsyslog.service`<br>
* Blank out the contents of `/usr/local/bin/wait_for_var_log_to_be_mounted`<br>
<br>
Either action will cause rsyslog to no longer wait for `/var/log` to be mounted before starting.<br>

#### <a id="621-108"></a> 621.108

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: March 01, 2021

**Known Issues**: <br>
<br>
This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:<br>
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. <br>
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy<br>
<br>
This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.<br>
<br>
This issue is fixed in stemcell version 621.109.<br>

**Priorities**: low,medium<br>
**Description**:<br>
  Elena Petrova discovered that the pin controller device tree implementation<br>
in the Linux kernel did not properly handle string references. A local<br>
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).<br>
(CVE-2020-0427)<br>
<br>
Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered<br>
that legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the<br>
Bluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete<br>
authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A<br>
physically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously<br>
paired Bluetooth device. (CVE-2020-10135)<br>
<br>
Andy Nguyen discovered that the Bluetooth A2MP implementation in the Linux<br>
kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically<br>
proximate remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information<br>
(kernel memory). (CVE-2020-12352)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem of<br>
the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker<br>
with access to the perf subsystem could use this to cause a denial of<br>
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-14351)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the frame buffer implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
did not properly handle some edge cases in software scrollback. A local<br>
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or<br>
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-14390)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the netfilter connection tracker for netlink in the<br>
Linux kernel did not properly perform bounds checking in some situations. A<br>
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).<br>
(CVE-2020-25211)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the Rados block device (rbd) driver in the Linux<br>
kernel did not properly perform privilege checks for access to rbd devices<br>
in some situations. A local attacker could use this to map or unmap rbd<br>
block devices. (CVE-2020-25284)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the HDLC PPP implementation in the Linux kernel did<br>
not properly validate input in some situations. A local attacker could use<br>
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute<br>
arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-25643)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the GENEVE tunnel implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
when combined with IPSec did not properly select IP routes in some<br>
situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information<br>
(unencrypted network traffic). (CVE-2020-25645)<br>
<br>
Keyu Man discovered that the ICMP global rate limiter in the Linux kernel<br>
could be used to assist in scanning open UDP ports. A remote attacker could<br>
use to facilitate attacks on UDP based services that depend on source port<br>
randomization. (CVE-2020-25705)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that the framebuffer implementation in the Linux kernel<br>
did not properly perform range checks in certain situations. A local<br>
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).<br>
(CVE-2020-28915)<br>
<br>
It was discovered that Power 9 processors could be coerced to expose<br>
information from the L1 cache in certain situations. A local attacker could<br>
use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-4788)<br>

#### <a id="456-213"></a> 456.213

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: December 06, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict access to the NATS message bus except by the bosh agent. This provides an additional layer of security so even if an attacker is able to gain access to the NATS credentials, they would be unable to use those from a workload on a Bosh deployed VM. If you are attempting to debug NATS connectivity problems by directly connecting to the Bosh NATS server, you will need additional access; instructions can be [found here](https://bosh.io/docs/tips/#unreachable-agent).<br>
<br>
#### Known Issue:<br>
Errors are present in the networking service post-start scripts for all BOSH-managed VMs which:<br>
<br>
* Causes networking service to report a failed state<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the monit service<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the NATS service<br>

#### <a id="456-186"></a> 456.186

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: September 14, 2021

#### Fixes<br>
* Updates the `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit` wrapper script to refer to `monit-actual` by absolute path, rather than relative path. This allows folks who reset or clear the `PATH` environment variable to actually be able to use the `monit` CLI. Prior to this fix, folks who cleared their `PATH` environment variable would see an error like: `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit: line 9: exec: monit-actual: not found`.<br>
* Fixes the "incorrect used memory reporting" issue introduced in stemcell version `456.176`. The Bosh Agent will now report the correct amount of memory used by all processes in the VM that it manages, rather than just the processes in its cgroup.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* We've seen failures with this version of the stemcell in vSphere when attempting to attach a persistent disk to a running VM. We are currently planning to address this issue with an update to the vSphere CPI. It should be fixed in vSphere CPI release >= v69. We have pulled the vSphere version of this stemcell.<br>

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: August 30, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict Monit API access to the Monit CLI and BOSH Agent. To see how to grant your program access to the Monit API, examine the new `monit` wrapper script, found at `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit`.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* The memory used by the VM that a Bosh Agent manages is incorrectly reported. The Agent will report very significantly smaller amounts of memory used by the VM than are actually used. This means that the "memory used" information in the output of `bosh vms --vitals` and related commands is incorrect. For now, avoid using this stemcell version, if you rely on the VM memory usage information reported by the Bosh Agent, Director, or the `bosh` CLI. <br>

**Release Date**: March 05, 2021

#### Fixes Issues:<br>
<br>
GCP rsyslog behavior is fixed - cf ssh and rsyslog should be working as expected<br>
<br>
#### Important Notice:<br>
<br>
As of this release, on all IAASs, rsyslog will not start until `/var/log` is mounted. When used with a Bosh Agent, `/var/log` will automatically be mounted, and no further action is required.<br>
<br>
If you use this stemcell without a Bosh Agent and do not mount `/var/log`, then you need to do one of these two actions:<br>
<br>
* Remove the `ExecStartPre=` line from `/etc/systemd/system/rsyslog.service`<br>
* Blank out the contents of `/usr/local/bin/wait_for_var_log_to_be_mounted`<br>
<br>
Either action will cause rsyslog to no longer wait for `/var/log` to be mounted before starting.<br>

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: March 01, 2021

**Known Issues**: <br>
<br>
This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:<br>
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. <br>
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy<br>
<br>
This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.<br>
<br>
This issue is fixed in stemcell version 456.146.<br>

<span class="pivnet">Available in the Broadcom Support portal</span>

**Release Date**: February 24, 2021

**Known Issues**: <br>
<br>
This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:<br>
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. <br>
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy<br>
<br>
This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.<br>
<br>
This issue is fixed in stemcell version 456.146.<br>
