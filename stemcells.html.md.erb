<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: March 01, 2021

**Known Issues**: 

This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:
* Attempts to use `cf ssh` timeout. 
* The `iptables-logger` job fails to deploy

This is because rsyslog is started before `/var/log` is mounted. This causes it to log to the root filesystem rather than the mounted persistent disk.

**Release Date**: August 21, 2020

This release changes the way the Linux Google light stemcell works to reference a source image. It will lead to a decrease in the time it takes to upload the light stemcell. This change will also help mitigate the impact of the new [GCP image creation rate limit](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/snapshot-best-practices#freq_limits) which any user uploading more than 6 GCP stemcells an hour would hit.

**Known Issues**: 

This version of the stemcell has the following issues when used on GCP:

Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen discovered
that legacy pairing and secure-connections pairing authentication in the
Bluetooth protocol could allow an unauthenticated user to complete
authentication without pairing credentials via adjacent access. A
physically proximate attacker could use this to impersonate a previously
paired Bluetooth device. (CVE-2020-10135)

Andy Nguyen discovered that the Bluetooth A2MP implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory in some situations. A physically
proximate remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information
(kernel memory). (CVE-2020-12352)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the perf subsystem of
the Linux kernel, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker
with access to the perf subsystem could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-14351)

situations. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information
(unencrypted network traffic). (CVE-2020-25645)

Keyu Man discovered that the ICMP global rate limiter in the Linux kernel

did not properly perform range checks in certain situations. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

#### <a id="3541-8"></a> 3541.8

**Release Date**: March 08, 2018

- Bump bosh-agent to 2.67.1
  - Agent will now respect previously set permissions and owner on sys/run, sys/log and data job directories
  - This should fix stemcell compatibility with Diego/Garden if Agent restarts
    - If you were using 3541.x stemcell for any of your deployments, it's recommended to update your deployments to this version before updating Director since that would cause Agent restart


#### <a id="3541-5"></a> 3541.5

**Release Date**: February 23, 2018

- Bump Ubuntu Trusty stemcells for USN-3582-2: Linux kernel (Xenial HWE) vulnerabilities

#### <a id="3541-4"></a> 3541.4

**Release Date**: February 15, 2018

- Rolled back custom umask configuration as we found out it was different in some cases (depends on how processes were started)
  - Hardening of /var/vcap/jobs/* is still applied by the agent

#### <a id="3541-2"></a> 3541.2

**Release Date**: February 09, 2018

- [breaking] Set default umask to 077 and further harden several /var/vcap/* directories
  - Note that you may have to change your release to adapt to this change
- [breaking] Renamed /var/vcap/bosh/bin/ntpdate to /var/vcap/bosh/bin/sync-time
- [breaking] Stop forwarding SSH events to bosh-agent
  - Agent no longer receives and forwards such events to HM. This should remove a lot of noisy generated by releases that expect a lot of SSH sessions (eg Gitlab). This information will continue to be available in logs forwarded to remote destinations (and locally /var/log/auth.log).
- Fixes `env.bosh.swap_size: 0` to work on more clouds (including GCP)

Misc

- Order stemcell tarballs so that upload-stemcell command can execute faster
- Generate `packages.txt` within stemcell tarball that includes list of installed packages (previously known under different name)

- Disable all IPv6 configurations
- Reenabled UDF kernel module for Azure
- Increase root_maxkeys and maxkeys kernel configurations

#### <a id='critical'></a> USN-3522-2 Addresses Meltdown Vulnerabilities

Meltdown exploits critical vulnerabilities in modern processors.
For more information about Meltdown, see [Meltdown and Spectre Attacks](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/meltdown-spectre-attacks/) on the Cloud Foundry blog.
[USN-3522-2](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/usn-3522-2/) addresses the critical vulnerability in Ubuntu associated with Meltdown.
</br>
</br>
This update may include degradations to performance if your VM's CPU and memory usage are currently at near-capacity levels.
Prior to upgrading to this stemcell, monitor your <%= vars.platform_name %> VM's current CPU and memory usage and scale those components if necessary. If any of your VMs are currently operating at 60% or above, VMware recommends scaling that VM.
For more information about the performance impact of Meltdown-related stemcell patches on <%= vars.platform_name %> components and guidance on scaling, see [Performance Impact of Cloud Foundry Apps and Services Because of Spectre and Meltdown](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Performance-Impact-of-Cloud-Foundry-Apps-and-Services-Because-of-Spectre-and-Meltdown) in the Knowledge Base.

For more information about monitoring and scaling <%= vars.platform_name %>, see [Monitoring <%= vars.platform_name %> VMs](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/monitoring.html),

and [Scaling <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/operating/scaling-ert-components.html). Performance degradation is likely to vary by workload type, IaaS, and other factors.
VMware recommends testing your deployment thoroughly after upgrading to this stemcell.
