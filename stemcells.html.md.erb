**Description**:<br>
  It was discovered that OpenSSL was not properly managing file locks when<br>
processing policy constraints. If a user or automated system were tricked<br>
into processing a certificate chain with specially crafted policy<br>
constraints, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a<br>
denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu<br>
22.10. (CVE-2022-3996)<br>
<br>
David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL was not properly performing the<br>
verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints,<br>
which could lead to excessive resource consumption. If a user or automated<br>
system were tricked into processing a specially crafted X.509 certificate<br>
chain that includes policy constraints, a remote attacker could possibly<br>
use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2023-0464)<br>
<br>
David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL was not properly handling invalid<br>
certificate policies in leaf certificates, which would result in certain<br>
policy checks being skipped for the certificate. If a user or automated<br>
system were tricked into processing a specially crafted certificate, a<br>
remote attacker could possibly use this issue to assert invalid<br>
certificate policies and circumvent policy checking. (CVE-2023-0465)<br>
<br>
David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly documented the<br>
functionalities of function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy, stating that<br>
it would implicitly enable certificate policy checks when doing<br>
certificate verifications, contrary to its implementation. This could<br>
cause users and applications to not perform certificate policy checks<br>
even when expected to do so. (CVE-2023-0466)<br>

**Release Date**: September 06, 2022

#### Known issues<br>
Xenial Stemcell Versions 621.241 through 621.305 contain a Linux kernel slab memory leak.<br>
<br>
Not all workloads and configurations are affected, but anyone planning to upgrade to one of these stemcell versions are urged to not use the affected versions and to use stemcell version 621.330 or later.<br>
<br>
For more information about how to detect the issue, please see this Knowledge Base article: <https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Slab-memory-leak-Ubuntu-Xenial><br>
<br>
**NOTE**: This issue has been resolved in Stemcell version 621.330.<br>
<br>
#### Fixes<br>
* There is an existing kernel bug in Xenial that can prevent the Precision Hardware Clock used in Azure stemcells from correctly tracking the time. To work around this problem we've changed the Azure stemcells to once again use the NTP servers in the config provided by BOSH. If your Azure network does not allow output NTP traffic to your configured NTP servers you may need to update your firewall rules to allow this traffic now.<br>

**Release Date**: December 17, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* `/var/opt` is now mounted to the ephemeral disk rather than the root disk. This is not a recommended storage point for bosh workloads, but some agents deployed on stemcells write their logs to this folder and that could cause the root disk to fill up.<br>
<br>
#### Fixes <br>
* This release reverts the NATS firewall enhancement added in 621.183. Changes associated with this feature caused VMs to report a networking failed state and prevented monit firewall rules from being applied. The NATS firewall enhancement will be reintroduced in a future release. <br>

#### <a id="621-183"></a> 621.183

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: December 06, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict access to the NATS message bus except by the bosh agent. This provides an additional layer of security so even if an attacker is able to gain access to the NATS credentials, they would be unable to use those from a workload on a Bosh deployed VM. If you are attempting to debug NATS connectivity problems by directly connecting to the Bosh NATS server, you will need additional access; instructions can be [found here](https://bosh.io/docs/tips/#unreachable-agent).<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
Errors are present in the networking service post-start scripts for all BOSH-managed VMs which:<br>
* Causes networking service to report a failed state<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the monit service<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the NATS service<br>

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: September 14, 2021

#### Fixes<br>
* Updates the `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit` wrapper script to refer to `monit-actual` by absolute path, rather than relative path. This allows folks who reset or clear the `PATH` environment variable to actually be able to use the `monit` CLI. Prior to this fix, folks who cleared their `PATH` environment variable would see an error like: `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit: line 9: exec: monit-actual: not found`.<br>
* Fixes the "incorrect used memory reporting" issue introduced in stemcell version `621.141`. The Bosh Agent will now report the correct amount of memory used by all processes in the VM that it manages, rather than just the processes in its cgroup.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* We've seen failures with this version of the stemcell in vSphere when attempting to attach a persistent disk to a running VM. We are currently planning to address this issue with an update to the vSphere CPI. It should be fixed in vSphere CPI release >= v69. We have pulled the vSphere version of this stemcell for now.<br>

#### <a id="621-141"></a> 621.141

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: August 30, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict Monit API access to the Monit CLI and BOSH Agent. To see how to grant your program access to the Monit API, examine the new `monit` wrapper script, found at `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit`.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* The memory used by the VM that a Bosh Agent manages is incorrectly reported. The Agent will report very significantly smaller amounts of memory used by the VM than are actually used. This means that the "memory used" information in the output of `bosh vms --vitals` and related commands is incorrect. For now, avoid using this stemcell version, if you rely on the VM memory usage information reported by the Bosh Agent, Director, or the `bosh` CLI.<br>
**NOTE**: This issue has been resolved in Stemcell version 621.151.<br>

#### <a id="456-213"></a> 456.213

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: December 06, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict access to the NATS message bus except by the bosh agent. This provides an additional layer of security so even if an attacker is able to gain access to the NATS credentials, they would be unable to use those from a workload on a Bosh deployed VM. If you are attempting to debug NATS connectivity problems by directly connecting to the Bosh NATS server, you will need additional access; instructions can be [found here](https://bosh.io/docs/tips/#unreachable-agent).<br>
<br>
#### Known Issue:<br>
Errors are present in the networking service post-start scripts for all BOSH-managed VMs which:<br>
<br>
* Causes networking service to report a failed state<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the monit service<br>
* Incorrectly allows external connections to the NATS service<br>

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: September 14, 2021

#### Fixes<br>
* Updates the `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit` wrapper script to refer to `monit-actual` by absolute path, rather than relative path. This allows folks who reset or clear the `PATH` environment variable to actually be able to use the `monit` CLI. Prior to this fix, folks who cleared their `PATH` environment variable would see an error like: `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit: line 9: exec: monit-actual: not found`.<br>
* Fixes the "incorrect used memory reporting" issue introduced in stemcell version `456.176`. The Bosh Agent will now report the correct amount of memory used by all processes in the VM that it manages, rather than just the processes in its cgroup.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* We've seen failures with this version of the stemcell in vSphere when attempting to attach a persistent disk to a running VM. We are currently planning to address this issue with an update to the vSphere CPI. It should be fixed in vSphere CPI release >= v69. We have pulled the vSphere version of this stemcell.<br>

<span class='pivnet'>Available in VMware Tanzu Network</span>

**Release Date**: August 30, 2021

#### Enhancements<br>
* Added firewall rules to restrict Monit API access to the Monit CLI and BOSH Agent. To see how to grant your program access to the Monit API, examine the new `monit` wrapper script, found at `/var/vcap/bosh/bin/monit`.<br>
<br>
#### Known issues<br>
* The memory used by the VM that a Bosh Agent manages is incorrectly reported. The Agent will report very significantly smaller amounts of memory used by the VM than are actually used. This means that the "memory used" information in the output of `bosh vms --vitals` and related commands is incorrect. For now, avoid using this stemcell version, if you rely on the VM memory usage information reported by the Bosh Agent, Director, or the `bosh` CLI. <br>
