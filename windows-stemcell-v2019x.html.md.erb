**Release Date**: September 26, 2019

### Bug Fix
- Fixed a bug that left user directories on the target machines after a user had terminated a BOSH SSH connection into that machine:
    - Deleted: `.ssh` directory and all normal files in the home directory that may have been created during the SSH session.
    - Not deleted: `.dat` files loaded as part of the registry hive when a user logs in. Files will exist with file locks until the next VM reboot.
