### Features

- Supports signed URL capability.
If Windows users opt in, the BOSH agent manages artifacts on the blobstore using signed URLs rather than blobstore credentials.
For more information on how to opt in to signed URLs, see
[Signed URLs](https://bosh.io/docs/director-blobstore-signed-urls/) in the _Cloud Foundry BOSH_ documentation.
- `stembuild` validates the VM OS is Windows Server 2019, OS build 17763. This is
the only OS version that stembuild v2019.x is compatible with.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where `stembuild construct` did not execute successfully if it could not fetch
updated root certificates from the public Windows Update Server.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must manually update your certificates if your VM does not have
  access to the public Windows Update Server.</p>
- Fixed a bug that tried to validate your VM credentials before connecting to the VM via WinRM.
For more information on the original validation bug, see ["Validating connection to vm..." step fails during stembuild construct for Stembuild v2019.15]
