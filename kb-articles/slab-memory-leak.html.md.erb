title: Slab Memory Leak on Ubuntu Xenial Stemcells
owner: Windows
---

This topic describes how to deal with a slab memory leak that can affect Tanzu Application Service (TAS for VMs) and TKGi environments that use Ubuntu Xenial stemcell versions 621.241 and higher.

This issue may result in intermittent unresponsive VMs. This problem has not been seen on all TAS and TKGi foundations, but only those with certain characteristics (BOSH add-ons, specific application workloads, for example).

`/proc/meminfo` shows low free memory and high Slab memory.

The `slabtop` command shows high memory usage by TCP.
